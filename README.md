# Mondrian Composition

This is a website consisting of 2 Mondrian Compositions.
I have prepared this website using HTML, CSS.

This project mainly focuses on the usage of Grid for creating these beautiful compositions.

Used JavaScript to randomize the colours of the compositions at the click of a button.
